                                        Upholding the novelty of IISER as an Institute meant to foster, nourish and evolve scientific
                                        thinking, Singularity aims to promote out-of-the-box thinking and inculcate scientific
                                        temperament in the youth. School Outreach programs are an integral part of it. With all the past
                                        editions of Singularity, we've successfully kept the fire of knowledge burning.
                                        Transcend the conventional boundaries of your classrooms with Singularity ’21!</p>

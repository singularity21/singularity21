									<p>The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal (IISERB) is an autonomous Institute of national importance, established in 2008 under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India. IISERs were set up as premier institutes for imparting education for research in fundamental sciences and to cater the nation's scientific advancements. 
										Like Louis Pasteur once said “Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world”. We, the Science Council at IISER Bhopal cordially invite all alacritous participants to take part in this year’s rendition of Singularity 2021 !
										</p>
									<p>Singularity, IISER Bhopal’s annual science fest is back with a bang, and we are as jubilant about it as you are! Ever since its inception in 2010, Singularity has expanded its entourage of influence, attracting college and school students alike to witness this extraordinary merry of science. HIghlighting the promethean nuances of IISER as an institute meant to patronize, endow and give oxygen to  scientific thinking, Singularity aims to promote out-of-the-box thinking and inculcate scientific ratiocination in the youth.
										With all the past renditions of Singularity, we've successfully kept the immortal and invigorating flame of knowledge burning, and we see no reason why this year should be any different! Not letting the physical distance between us hinder our ingenious curiosity, Singularity 2021 has shifted to an online platform. We bring to you a whole week packed with a wide array of events, from inspiring talks by eminent scientists to showcasing exquisite scientific phenomena through poetry, there is something for everyone! Singularity 2021 is also proud to introduce the new events ‘Quirky Quills’ and ‘What’s wrong with the scene’, all while continuing the tradition and bringing to you some ever-popular, crowd favourite events like the Treasure Hunt, Number’s Game , Hunting the Heavens and BAH.
										With stochastic times all around us,we often wish to embark on something new, ecstatic and collaborative. In a gravity of colors, Singularity 2021 endeavours to maintain its position as a unique fest,reaching out to all kinds of students and enthusiasts across the country. Outgun the humdrums of your online classes and join us on an enticing quest at Singularity 2021 !!
										Join us in celebrating science, for Science Still Prevails! .

He has authored several school, undergraduate and graduate textbooks, 
										the most popular being Concepts of Physics (one of the best books for jee preparation). He popularised physics by creating a link between what students learn with their real lives.
										 Verma has developed more than six hundred ‘low cost’ physics experiments which teachers can employ in their classrooms

He founded ASU's Origins Project, now called ASU Interplanetary Initiative, to investigate fundamental questions about the
										 universe and served as the project's director. Krauss is the author of several bestselling books, including The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe from Nothing , 
										 and chaired the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Board of Sponsors. Krauss is one of very few to have received awards from all three major American physics societies: 
										 the American Physical Society, the American Association of Physics Teachers, and the American Institute of Physics. 
										 He is termed as one of the top physicists living currently.

										Reasoning involves premises, conclusions, and the derivation of the conclusions from
										the premises. It plays a role in scientific inquiry in the following components:</br>
										A) in deducing predictions from the premises (definitions and laws) of a scientific
										theory (parallel to deriving theorems from the axioms and definitions of a
										mathematical theory);</br>
										B) in establishing observational generalisations (e.g., experimental
										hypotheses) on the basis of a sample of observational reports (data points);
										and</br>
										C) in establishing the credibility of scientific theories.
										These functions of reasoning in scientific inquiry call for different systems of logic. In this
										talk, I will take the audience on a quick tour through these systems of logic, and the kinds
										of reasoning that these logics allow us to express.
